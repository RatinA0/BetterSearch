# BetterSearch
FX Console but for VEGAS Pro, search and apply FX or generate generators

## Usage
"Where do I put this?" - in either one of these folders, create a new folder if it doesn't exist yet:
- `C:\Users\...\Documents\Vegas Application Extensions\`
- `C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Vegas Pro\Application Extensions\`
- `C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming\Vegas Pro\Application Extensions\`
- `C:\Program Data\Vegas Pro\Application Extensions\`

How to add it as a shortcut (optionally you can just dock it and not worry about opening it up again):
- Options -> Customize Keyboard -> ( if you don't have a separate already: Save As... -> name it then select it -> )
`Show commands containing:` BetterSearch ->
`Shortcut keys:` Shift + Space ( or whatever you'd like to use ) -> `[Add]` -> `[OK]`

## TODO:
- [ ] color code in the first list: videoFX, audioFX and generators
- [ ] fix close on apply? (-> double click / enter)
